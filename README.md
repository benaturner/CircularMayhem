# CircularMayhem
Circular Mayhem is a simple Unity game written in C# that I created as part of Blackthornprod's Game Dev Rocket program.
Included in this repository are the scripts for the Player, Hazards, and Spawner game objects.

Player.cs: This script defines the movement speed of the object and allows player input to control its movement as it rotates around the planet in the center of the screen.

Hazard.cs: This script not only controls the movement of the hazards, but it also randomizes the speed of the object and controls collision interactions with other game objects.

Spawner.cs: This script controls the spawn rate of the hazards and randomizes their spawn locations.
